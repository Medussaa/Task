			Live Python + Numpy Coding Test
			================================

Imagine you have registered your User ID (data_science@xyz.com) and set password (123456) with bank and You are trying to login into bank portal.

Write python + numpy code to validate user entered id and password. If id or password is wrong then ask if user forgot the password with Y/N options, if user says 'Y' then generate 6 digit OTP and validate the OTP, if user says 'N' then ask user to renter the details again. If the wrong OTP is entered, you need to allow user 3 attempts for the same OTP. If all the attempts fails then print max attempts reached try after sometime. Print appropriate messages at every condition to let user know the status.


Note: 
1.Submit Your answers in the chat box (you can copy the code and paste in the chat box) we will verify the answer once all of you submit the answers.
2. We will also upload code/Answer in the same github folder in the evening. You can check and verify your answers.
3. Don't treat our code is the only way to write, there are many ways to write code.
